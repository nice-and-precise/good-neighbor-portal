# Feature 001: Autonomous Audit Scaffold

Purpose: Provide a minimal Spec Kit feature directory so prerequisite checks pass and audits can run without manual prompts.

## Goals
- Establish spec/plan/tasks placeholders for the audit runner.
- Keep content minimal and non-binding; this is a scaffold only.

## Non-Goals
- Implement the full audit logic here (lives in tools and prompts).
