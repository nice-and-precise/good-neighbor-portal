# m3.1 – Recent Activity and Multi-tenant Demo

Highlights:
- Added `/api/recent_activity.php` combining recent service requests and billing entries
- Frontend: Recent Activity card, clickable items, and tenant badge
- Seeded a second tenant (`kandiyohi-mn`) with neighborhoods and addresses
- E2E test script now accepts `-Tenant` and validates activity feed for each tenant

Technical:
- CI GitHub Actions workflow executes end-to-end tests on push/PR for both tenants
- PHP 8.1 with SQLite (`pdo_sqlite`, `sqlite3`) on CI and dev server

Upgrade notes:
- No data migrations required beyond `setup.ps1` seeding
