## Vibe Coding Support

**Priority:** working code over perfect architecture

**For rapid sessions:**
- Generate conventional commit messages automatically
- Focus on happy path first, edge cases in follow-ups
- Use TODO comments for optimizations
- Suggest minimal test coverage for new endpoints

**Code quality shortcuts allowed:**
- Skip comprehensive error handling for prototypes
- Placeholder comments for complex validations
- Defer optimization until feature complete

**Auto-decisions:**
- Assume direct commit unless > 3 files substantially changed
- Pick reasonable defaults when info missing
- Provide next iteration suggestions as comments
