# Contributing

This project follows Spec-Driven Development with GitHub Spec Kit.

- Start with /constitution → /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks.
- Use feature branches with atomic commits.
- Keep docs (docs/spec.md, docs/plan.md, docs/tasks.md) up to date.
- Add or update tests when changing behavior.
- Prefer minimal, pinned dependencies.
- Never commit secrets.
